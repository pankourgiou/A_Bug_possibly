# A_Bug_possibly
So I decrypted tool band language and I used it to create a programming language I call Christina...that's part one--->Gold =  GTCTGTATCTAC in DNA language but in Christina language it is Hagawapa(at least in Christina 7) GTCTGTATCTAC is different to TCGACTGTCACTATGACT Kagawa but Wolfram alpha
when I go to the linguistics sections translates Hagawapa to Kagawa(translated AOL in tool band language) city in Japan....then I try something different...I give misthountkimirui which is love in Kaotican and (Christina 1 programming language I created) but Wolfram alpha's answer is Misthosima which is an insect a bug...
and it's true that it's inaccurate since love = ATCTGTGTACTA in DNA language is different to Mistoshima = ACACTGTGATAGCGTTGTTGACTGACAACT. I am sure there are many examples like this...and since I am not sure about the possible debugging process:) I inform.
